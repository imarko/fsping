fsping is a utility to find hanging or slow to respond filesystems. By
default it checks all currently mounted NFS filesystems with a 5
second timeout. No output and zero exit status means all is good. 

Use -v to get timing stats for responsive filesystems.  
(may not be fully accurate)

  -a, --all=false: check all filesystems types
  -d, --dev=false: show device
  -p, --path=true: show path
  -q, --quiet=false: quiet mode, only set exit status
  -T, --timeout=5s: timeout (ex: 100ms or 3s)
  -t, --type="nfs": filesystem type to check
  -v, --verbose=false: verbose
